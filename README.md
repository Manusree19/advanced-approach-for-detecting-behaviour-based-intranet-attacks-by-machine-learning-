🔐 Advanced Approach for Detecting Behavior-Based Intranet Attacks Using Machine Learning

> A machine learning-based system designed to detect abnormal user behavior and potential intranet attacks through pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and classification techniques.

---

 🧠 Objective

This project aims to enhance network security by identifying **behavioral anomalies** within an **intranet environment** using **machine learning**. It focuses on detecting internal threats such as privilege misuse, lateral movement, or insider attacks that may not be captured by traditional security systems.

 📌 Key Highlights

- Detects unusual user or host behavior within a private network
- Applies machine learning algorithms to log or traffic data
- Classifies traffic as normal or suspicious based on behavioral features
- Reduces false positives using intelligent filtering and thresholding
- Supports visualization of alerts and model accuracy
